# Chatter

This is a [code along](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-real-time-chat-app-with-react-nestjs-graphql/learn/lecture/39410038#overview) (by Michael Guay) to build a chat app using production-ready methods. This is the first nest app I've built (Feb-Mar 2024). 

## Tech stack
<!-- - NestJS backend
- CRUD functionality will be served by a GraphQL API 
-  MongoDB database using Abstract Repository pattern
-- Use MongoDB aggregation to perform single operation lookups & DB calls -->

<!-- - Use GraphQL WebSocket Subscriptions to publish & consume messages in real time -->
- React Router
<!-- - server-side pagination to implement infinite scrolling -->
<!-- - JWT auth -->
- UI: React App using Material UI
<!-- - Apollo Client for state management -->
<!-- - deployed onto AWS Elastic Beanstalk & Amplify -->
<!-- - CI/CD pipeline -->
<!-- - Connect a Pub/Sub app to Redis to allow for distributed messages & horizontal scaling -->
<!-- - Connect a app to a custom domain & secure HTTPS traffic -->


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I plan to rebuild using my preferred tech stack.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
